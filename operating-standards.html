    <h1>VV HOME PRO: Vetted & Verified Operating Standards</h1>

    <p>To be authorized as a <strong>VV-Verified Partner</strong>, a contractor affirms that they meet, and will continually abide by, the following standards:</p>

    <h2>1. Build Elite Trust</h2>
    <p>Establish and maintain an exemplary track record of performance and professionalism.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A. Proven Stability:</strong> Actively providing services in their trade for at least <strong>two years</strong> prior to application, or providing verified documentation of similar experience under a different business entity.</li>
        <li><strong>B. Verified Credentials:</strong> Hold all required local, state, and provincial competency licenses, and maintain active, high-limit General Liability and Workers' Compensation insurance.</li>
        <li><strong>C. Ethical Standing:</strong> Be free from government action, litigation, or regulatory sanctions that demonstrate a failure to support VV HOME PRO’s principles of honesty and quality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Advertise with Integrity</h2>
    <p>Follow established legal and ethical advertising practices, ensuring all representations are accurate and substantiated.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A. Accurate Scope:</strong> Clearly distinguish between services they directly perform and those they subcontract.</li>
        <li><strong>B. Trademark Usage:</strong> Use the <strong>VV HOME PRO "Vetted & Verified"</strong> badge only while in good standing, adhering strictly to the usage policies provided in the Partner Handbook.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Commit to Total Transparency</h2>
    <p>Openly disclose the business's nature, location, ownership, and all material facts affecting a customer's buying decision.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A. Immediate Disclosure:</strong> Promptly provide VV HOME PRO with documentation needed to verify compliance (licensing, insurance certificates, portfolio references).</li>
        <li><strong>B. Customer Clarity:</strong> Before work commences, provide customers with a clear, itemized scope of work, total cost (including tax/fees), direct contact information, and a clear warranty policy on craftsmanship.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Honor Commitments</h2>
    <p>Fulfill all contracts, promises, and representations in good faith.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A. Deadline Accountability:</strong> Make reasonable efforts to adhere to estimated start and completion dates, communicating delays proactively.</li>
        <li><strong>B. Quality Assurance:</strong> Ensure the completed project meets the quality standards agreed upon in the contract.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Proactive Responsiveness</h2>

        <li><strong>B. Professionalism:</strong> Address all significant issues raised by a client with appropriate documentation supporting the contractor's position.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Safeguard Information</h2>
    <p>Protect client data against unauthorized disclosure and respect customer privacy preferences.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A. Data Security:</strong> Ensure sensitive data (financial information, home access codes, personal addresses) is transmitted and stored securely according to industry standards.</li>
        <li><strong>B. Confidentiality:</strong> Respect customer preferences regarding contact frequency and do not share client information with third-party marketing services without explicit permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Embody Professionalism</h2>
    <p>Approach all business dealings with integrity, respecting the homeowner's property and time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A. Job Site Conduct:</strong> Maintain a safe, clean, and professional job site.</li>

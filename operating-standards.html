    <ul>
        <li><strong>A. Proven Stability:</strong> Actively providing services in their trade for at least <strong>two years</strong> prior to application, or providing verified documentation of similar experience under a different business entity.</li>
        <li><strong>B. Verified Credentials:</strong> Hold all required local, state, and provincial competency licenses, and maintain active, high-limit General Liability and Workers' Compensation insurance.</li>
        <li><strong>C. Ethical Standing:</strong> Be free from government action, litigation, or regulatory sanctions that demonstrate a failure to support VV HOME PRO’s principles of honesty and quality.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Commit to Total Transparency</h2>

        <li><strong>B. Customer Clarity:</strong> Before work commences, provide customers with:
            <ul>
                <li>A clear, itemized scope of work.</li>

    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 15, 2026</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing the VETTED & VERIFIED HOME PRO (VVHP) website and utilizing our proprietary matching engine, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, all applicable laws and regulations in the Province of Ontario, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>VVHP operates as a high-end matchmaking platform. We utilize proprietary audit standards (The "Pinnacle Audit") to verify the credentials of trade professionals. VVHP is <strong>not</strong> a construction company, general contractor, or licensed trade entity. We provide a bridge between homeowners and independent service providers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. No Contractor-Client Relationship</h2>
        <p>The use of our matching portal does not create a contractor-client relationship between you and VVHP. Any engagement, contract, or agreement for physical work is strictly between the User (Homeowner) and the independent Service Professional matched through our system.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Vetting Disclaimer & User Responsibility</h2>
        <p>While VVHP performs rigorous audits of licenses (ESA, TSSA, etc.) and insurance (WSIB, Liability), these audits represent a "point-in-time" verification. Users are encouraged to perform their own final due diligence. VVHP does not guarantee the quality of workmanship or the fitness of a specific professional for a specific task.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall VETTED & VERIFIED HOME PRO, its directors, or its affiliates be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the work performed by a matched professional, or the inability to use the materials on VVHP’s website.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>Any claim relating to VVHP’s website shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
